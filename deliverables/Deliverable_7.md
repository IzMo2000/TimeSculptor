# Description
TimeSculptor is a scheduling app that aims to provide a seemless and user friendly experience, with a particular emphasis on being accessible for people with learning disabilities. It provides an accessible interface that adheres to guidelines outlined in [Pavlov (2014)](https://www.scirp.org/html/7-9301792_43152.htm) and [Moreno et al. (2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10209-023-00986-z). The primary expected consumer segment individuals who possess learning disabilities, but this ultimately makes the app accessible for everyone. Upon logging in, you are then given the options to create events or edit your schedule's current events. You can utilize color coding, and assigning different symbols to your events. Additionally, there are three viewing modes: list, monthly, and daily.

# Verification
Verification aims to ensure that you correctly developed the product. 

For this deliverable, show an example of a unit test that uses mock objects to isolate the class from the rest of the system. 

Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.)
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.
An example of a test case that makes use of mock objects. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.
A print screen showing the result of the unit tests execution. 
Grading criteria (5 points): adequate choice of a test framework, coverage of the tests, quality of the tests, adequate use of Mock objects, and a print screen showing successful test execution.

# Acceptance Test
An acceptance test is a test that verifies the correct implementation of a feature from the user interface perspective. An acceptance test is a black box test (the system is tested without knowledge about its internal implementation). Provide the following information:

Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., Selenium, Katalon Studio, Espresso2, Cucumber, etc.)
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated acceptance tests are located.
An example of an acceptance test. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the test and an explanation about the tested feature.
A print screen/video showing the acceptance test execution. 
Grading criteria (7 points): adequate choice of a test framework, coverage of the tests, quality of the tests, adequate example of an acceptance test, print screen/video showing successful tests execution.

# Validation
At the beginning of the semester, you talked to the clients/potential users to understand their needs. Now it is time to check if you are on the right track by conducting some user evaluation on the actual system. Include in this deliverable the following information:

**Script:** The script should have the tasks that you gave to the user, what data you collected, and the questions you asked. In particular, do not forget to add questions about the users’ general impressions. You can ask open questions (e.g., How would you describe the homepage of our app? How do you compare our system to the competitor X?) or closed questions (On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the layout of our application? On the same scale, how likely would you use the system in its current state?). Take a look at the inception and requirements deliverables to help create the script. Design a script to check if you are achieving your initial goals and if the features are implemented in a satisfactory way. 

**Results:** Conduct the user evaluation with at least 3 users. Report the data that you collected.

**Reflections:** Reflect on what you observed. Some questions that you can explore: What features worked well? What can be changed? How is the learning curve of your system? Did the users perform the tasks as you expected? Did the users’ actions produce the results they expected? What did the users like the most? Is your value proposition accomplished? 

Grading criteria (17 points): adequate script, adequate report of the results, adequate reflection, language.
