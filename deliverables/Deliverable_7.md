# Description
TimeSculptor is a scheduling app that aims to provide a seemless and user friendly experience, with a particular emphasis on being accessible for people with learning disabilities. It provides an accessible interface that adheres to guidelines outlined in [Pavlov (2014)](https://www.scirp.org/html/7-9301792_43152.htm) and [Moreno et al. (2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10209-023-00986-z). The primary expected consumer segment individuals who possess learning disabilities, but this ultimately makes the app accessible for everyone. Upon logging in, you are then given the options to create events or edit your schedule's current events. You can utilize color coding, and assigning different symbols to your events. Additionally, there are three viewing modes: list, monthly, and daily.

# Verification
For the testing of our program we decided to use jest as our automated testing software. 

link for testing: [Here](https://github.com/nickw409/TimeSculptor/tree/main/TimeSculptor/src/components/__tests__)

an example of a test case is the [calendar.jsx](https://github.com/nickw409/TimeSculptor/tree/main/TimeSculptor/src/components/calendar.jsx) file, in our tests, the first test in the [calendar.test.js](https://github.com/nickw409/TimeSculptor/tree/main/TimeSculptor/src/components/__tests__/calendar.test.js) file is seeing that the correct month is displayed based on a set of mock events and date. 

Below is the output of the current tests being ran:

# Acceptance Test
For our acceptance test we used selenium to test our program

link for testing: [Here](https://github.com/nickw409/TimeSculptor/tree/main/TimeSculptor/src/components/__tests__)

An example of an acceptance test is in the [loginTest.js](https://github.com/nickw409/TimeSculptor/tree/main/TimeSculptor/src/components/__tests__/loginTest.js) file, where we test that the login page, created in the [login.jsc](https://github.com/nickw409/TimeSculptor/tree/main/TimeSculptor/src/login.jsx) file correctly gets the credentials from the user and logs in.

**Results:** 

*Interview 1:*

Interviewer: Noah Schwartz

Interviewee: Graham Jacoby (does have diagnosed ADHD)

General Overview of Interview: 

- Liked the calendar view
- Disliked the navigation to color and icon choosing
- Liked the color customization to differentiate between events
- Thinks the "Pick a Time" button would be nice for those events hard to prioritize due to ADHD 
- Found the icons to not be super useful, maybe due in part to size or limited choices
- Doesn't think he'd use it over his current choice of application just due to the fact that it's still a prototype

**Reflections:** Reflect on what you observed. Some questions that you can explore: What features worked well? What can be changed? How is the learning curve of your system? Did the users perform the tasks as you expected? Did the usersâ€™ actions produce the results they expected? What did the users like the most? Is your value proposition accomplished? 

Grading criteria (17 points): adequate script, adequate report of the results, adequate reflection, language.
