Some alternatives for deploying your system in the cloud:

Digital Ocean or Azzure. As part of the GitHub Education benefits, as a student, you can get $100 at Digital Ocean and $100 at Microsoft Azzure cloud computing platforms (see more details at https://education.github.com/students).
Oracle Cloud. Oracle offers a free tier in its cloud environment that should be more than enough for your needs.
Firebase. Firebase can be a good choice if you are building a mobile phone app.
