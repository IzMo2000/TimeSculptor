## **Project Retrospective**

**Appreciations:** Everyone persisted and made it through the week, everyone had Midterms through the week but we still did the necessary work.

**Successes:** Deliverable 3 is very close to completion. We were able to get a new project idea that was approved by Dr. Palmer.

**Failures:** Learning the new technologies was put on the backburner.

**Barriers:** Very busy time of the semester, led to less progress than was ideal.

**What We Should Try Next Time:** N/A

## **Next Steps**

- Continue Learning assigned technologies.
- Finish out Deliverable 3 by the soft deadline (tommorrow).
- Put together presentation for Midterm presentation by Wednesday.

## **Decisions**

- Have a meeting on Sunday @ 10AM to go over the slides.
- Prioritize learning the assigned technologies next week.
- Write actual code that will be used in the project.
