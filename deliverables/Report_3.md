## Project Retrospective

**Appreciations:** Everyone did what they were assigned to do.

**Successes:** Communication has remained consistent, it still feels like everyone is contributing equally

**Failures:** Team was un a rush to turn in everything by Sunday, we should consider setting a "soft" deadline 

**Barriers:** None at this time

**What We Should Try Next Time:** 

Submit Report and possible Deliverables by Saturday night. We also want to start editing the branches on our own machines, as we have just been editing the branches on GitHub.

## Next Steps
     1. Begin looking into JS and SQL/SQLite
     2. Begin planning the different pages of the website (login, calendar, etc...)
     3. Finish up the different remaining components of deliverable 2

## Decisions

-Setting a soft deadline for reports/deliverables on the Saturday before they are due.

- Gabriel
- Kimberly

The following members will be investigating back end(Node.js and sqllite)

- Nick
- Joey
- Noah
