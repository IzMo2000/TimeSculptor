**Concept Outline**

We want to make a scheduling web app that is more flexible and contains unique features from other scheduling apps, for precise features we plan on further developing them as we gain more market insight from our interviews.

**Technologies**

We will use HTML/CSS/Javascript as our frontend, C++ as our backend programming language, along with database integration using SQL. We will most likely use AWS or something else to host.

It is assumed that throughout the semester, all members will be working with the backend/frontend at some point. As a result, it will be expected that members learn the necessary tools in the given language (i.e C++/JS) to complete the tasks that are assigned. If a member decides to incorporate a more niche technology, such as a library or API, it is expected that they document how they used it in their contributions for the week. This member should also link to the documentation when a new technology is introduced, and properly comment the code that uses it

**Handling Conflicts**

At the beginning of the meetings we will discuss what we've done throughout the week and anybody who is lacking in their contributions can figure out what to do differently and what they can do in the week ahead.

We opt for the majority rules decision making.

Problems will be addressed as they come up, nothing's personal, it's not that serious.

If someone misses a meeting they'll have to update the meeting report sheet early with their contributions so they can still be discussed during the meeting with everyone else. If it is last-minute and an emergency, it can be addressed at the meeting and taken care of shortly after.

**Interview Outline**

Aiming for 12 interviews in total, 6 students and 6 professors. More interviews never hurt.
